This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 

Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb] 
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. The first two columns are Date and Time.
